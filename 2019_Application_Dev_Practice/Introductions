This folder shows what I have done during the application development practice, from 2019-10-08 to 2019-11-09.
The practice is compulsory to my major. Though it takes too much time to review for the Graduation Extrance Examination.

+ Background:
  I dont want to talk about it.
  "Their road will be long and hard. For the enemy is strong. He may hurl back our forces. 
    Success may not come with rushing speed, but we shall return again and again."


+ Requirements && Team division
  No more than one month, re-development a software based on "QuantyView3D"[*1], within following functions:
  (1).Generate and show 3D models of mining area's surface;
  (2).Generate and show 3D models of geospheres and samples'data where drills penetrate;
  (3).Merge data of the rock samples;
  (4).Generate and show 3D models of the ore surface;
  (5).Generate and show 3D models of the ore body;
  (6).IDW estimate;
  (7).Print report forms accroding to data from (6);
  (8).A geo-database of the mining area;
  (9).Surface analysis of 3D models;
  (10).Compatiable clustering and discrimination methods of drill data.
  
  About division:
  I belongs to team:heli technology and we have 10 members to finish the task.
  Fortunately, a GOAT(not pejorative) ---- who was awared the prize of 11th Li Siguang Innovation Project,  belongs to our team too.
    + She individually completed the code progress of 3 functions!
    + I haven't received her assistance, actually, because the function assigned to us do nothing with each other. 
    
  Function no.10 was assigned to me, I complete it in time and I helped finishing function no.1/5.4.
  Besides, I took part in the general design of the whole software, the framework, for example. 
    + Function no.10 is a totally new requirement and it hasn't occurred to the elder students.
    + So I choose it, I don't want to copy or lift.
    + Sadly my teammates lift a lot. My classmates copy a lift.
