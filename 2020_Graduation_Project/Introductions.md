This folder shows what I have done during the graduation Project, from 2019-12-23 to 2020-6-1.

+ Timeline && Critical Progress:  

  2019-12-23 Begin learning.  
  
  2019-12-30 SOLVE A CRITICAL PROBLEM : Mix of multiple earthquake properities.
    + Finish an algorithm of mix. The word 'mix' is of very abstract. I spend time on how to use code to reflect the process of data mix.
    + Then it takes me few time to complete the python code. ---- Now I love python.(Not)Really.
    
  2020-01-01 HAPPY NEW YEAR!
    
  2020-02-03 Test K-Means Data Dimension Reduction.
    
  2020-02-05 Complie Analysis Documents for associated oil well. 
    + ( Delay Coding until finish, asked by the supervisior.)
    
  2020-02-20 Finish all the analysis documents(40 oil well).
    
  2020-02-20 Test Sectional Graph Painting Methods.
    + It takes much time to correct the ordinate system! 
    
  2020-02-24 SOLVE A CRITICAL PROBLEM ------ Correct Cluster Methods
    + Others graduates failed to code it correctly. I make it.  
    
  
  <font color=#4169E1>2020-03-02 Reconstruct Sectional Graph Painting Mthods. </font>
    + Reconstruct it by OpenCV instead of the previous matplotlib.  
    
+ Comments:  

  [1] Actually the theme of my project is part of college-level science and technology innovation project. 
      During that time I could not find out any idea of it. And I asked my supervisor for turning it into my graduate project.
      (My supervisor require students to work with her team as a graduate, while I prefer other high-level universities.)
